# Dvoyna Vault UI Color Contract

Status: Canonical

Dvoyna Vault uses a restrained semantic palette. The executable color values in `tailwind.config.js` are authoritative; this document defines their roles.

## Semantic roles

- **Sage** is the champagne-gold brand tone for primary actions, navigation and selection, ordinary progress, and positive states. On dark surfaces it reads as warm gold against black.
- **Amethyst** identifies AI-assisted features. Do not use it for stacks, versions, collection thumbnails, or non-AI background work.
- **Harbor** is informational. Use it for discovery, online lookup context, and non-AI background activity, never as a competing primary-action color.
- **Ember** marks warnings, missing information, modified metadata, and attention states. It replaces semantic amber, orange, and yellow.
- **Red** is limited to errors, destructive operations, and Removed. Prefer tinted surfaces; reserve solid red for destructive confirmation.
- **Favorite** is one soft rose, `--color-favorite` (`#E8838F`). Hearts use it at 85% opacity. Chips and badges use the same color as a very light translucent surface. The sidebar favorite button keeps the gold background and uses this rose for the heart.
- **Neutrals** identify providers, resource types, metadata categories, and ordinary filter chips.

For small colored text, use `*-600` on light surfaces and `*-300` on dark surfaces. Use lighter steps for backgrounds and borders. Pair every color cue with text, an icon, or another non-color signal.

## Exceptions

User-selected collection colors and chart series may use broader hues because they represent user content or data categories. Keep their labels visible and avoid treating those colors as application semantics.

The media canvas remains dark for image and video viewing. The shared viewer sidebar follows the selected application theme.
